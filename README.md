# Stitching Together the Three Pillars

## Learning Goals

- Identify the three essential pillars of front-end web programming
- Cause a change to given code so that DOM updating effect is seen
- Cause a change to given code so that event listening has an effect
- Cause a change to given code so that server-side behavior is stubbed in

## Introduction

Knowing what web programming is and how its elements work together is an
essential first step, but after you've got the fundamentals, you'll really want
to see it in action. The good news is, you probably already have. You most
likely have dozens of web interactions every day that rely on JavaScript to
send, collect and change information. Even if it's something as simple as
clicking an empty heart on a social media post to "favorite" it and seeing the
heart turn red.

### Identify the Three Essential Pillars of Front-End Web Programming

We've introduced our three essential pillars of front-end web programming:

  - Manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM)
  - Recognizing JS events
  - Communication with the server

We also described the interaction that we want to make: "favoriting" an item on
social media to turn an empty heart to red. Now, let's pull it all together and
see how it works by walking through some code.

### Cause a Change to Given Code So That DOM Updating Effect Is Seen

- instructions about how to change the code
- animated gif illustrating the desired change

### Cause a Change to Given Code So That Event Listening Has an Effect

- instructions about how to change the code
- animated gif illustrating the desired change

### Cause a Change to Given Code So That Server-Side Behavior Is Stubbed in

- instructions about how to change the code
- animated gif illustrating the desired change

## Conclusion

We're starting to see how the pieces work together now. Now, we're ready to dive
into the individual pillars and learn more about how each function. First, we
take on manipulating the DOM.
