# Stitching Together the Three Pillars

## Learning Goals

- Identify the three essential pillars of front-end web programming
- Cause a change to given code so that DOM updating effect is seen
- Cause a change to given code so that event listening has an effect
- Cause a change to given code so that server-side behavior is stubbed in

## Introduction

Knowing what web programming is and how its elements work together conceptually
is an essential first step. But in order to help orient our upcoming lessons,
let's see it in action. In this lesson we've provided you a simple social media
application called "Simple Liker." You'll see several posts which can be "liked"
by clicking on the heart...well, they could be if the critical code hadn't
been commented out. This lesson will guide you in uncommenting the critical
code so that you restore the "like" functionality. In subsequent lessons, you'll
learn the skills needd to create the pieces that you'll stitch together in this
lesson.

### Identify the Three Essential Pillars of Front-End Web Programming

We've introduced our three essential pillars of front-end web programming:

  - Manipulating the Document Object Model (DOM)
  - Recognizing JS events
  - Communication with the server

We also described the interaction that we want to make: "favoriting" an item on
social media to turn an empty heart to red. Now, let's pull it all together and
see how it works by walking through some code.

### Cause a Change to Given Code So That DOM Updating Effect Is Seen

- instructions about how to change the code
- animated gif illustrating the desired change

### Cause a Change to Given Code So That Event Listening Has an Effect

- instructions about how to change the code
- animated gif illustrating the desired change

### Cause a Change to Given Code So That Server-Side Behavior Is Stubbed in

- instructions about how to change the code
- animated gif illustrating the desired change

## Conclusion

We're starting to see how the pieces work together now. Now, we're ready to dive
into the individual pillars and learn more about how each function. First, we
take on manipulating the DOM.
